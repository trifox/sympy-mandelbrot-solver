# sympy-mandelbrot-solver
A sympy python jupiter workbook for symbolic evaluation of mandelbrot equation solutions at iteration n
# State of the Art

right now it is the notebook and compiles and finishes for up to level 5 in reasonable time, after that the calculation is exploding and not finishing in near time, having issues making use of the fast theano implementations, or even compiled python

# Planned

this repository is a base for dealing with mandelbrot roots, it shall make use of the fast theano output implementations, somehow not working yet

limiting to an area of root findings, sympy shall be able to route it only to a specific region for calulcating the roots of
